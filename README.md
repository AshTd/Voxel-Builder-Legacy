# Voxel Builder
A voxel model building program.

The Voxel Builder is a Python-based project that allows you to create beautiful 3D voxel models using procedural generation techniques. The project uses the [Noise](https://pypi.org/project/noise/) library to generate the [Perlin noise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perlin_noise).

By algorithmically generating the content, complex models can be created with intricate details without any manual design.

*Voxels are small cubic elements that are used to create a three-dimensional grid in virtual environment. Much like a pixel represents a 2D unit of space in a digital image!

## Requirements
- [Python 3.10](https://www.python.org/downloads/) or higher
- [NumPy](https://numpy.org)
- [Noise](https://pypi.org/project/noise/)
- [TQDM](https://pypi.org/project/tqdm/)
- [Any program to open .vox files](https://ephtracy.github.io)
