# Voxel-Builder
A voxel model building program.
The goal of this project is to generate a voxel model using procedural generation techniques.
Voxel models are 3D pixelated models, where each voxel represents a 3-dimentional pixel. Procedural generation is a technique used to generate content algorithmically, rather than manually creating it. By combining these two techniques, you can create complex 3D models with intricate details, without having to manually design every aspect of it into a single .vox file.
With the help of this project, users can easily generate complex 3D models with minimal effort, saving time and resources.
